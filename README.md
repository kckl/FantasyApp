<h2> NBA Fantasy Helper </h2>

For all *NBA fantasy lovers*, this tool can be used to help with drafting, analyzing, and visualizing how your team is doing relative to the rest of the league. 
Personally, as someone who enjoys playing fantasy and watching the NBA, I'd be interested in implementing this tool for future seasons and to ultimately, win the league!

#### Main Functionality:
- Create an NBA fantasy team, then input each player's information (eg. name, per game statistics) to build out a fantasy team
- Using a 5 category format, the tool will show how the team's performance in each statistical category
- Add multiple teams to the league to show a leaderboard
- Draft multiple players to a team
